        <h2>Study abroad Experience</h2>
            <p>During her study abroad experience in Rome, Katherine Ron immersed herself 
                in Italian language and culture, significantly enhancing her proficiency 
                in the language. Living in a new environment allowed her to adapt to different 
                cultural norms and practices while constantly traveling and exploring the city.
