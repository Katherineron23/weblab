        <h2>Study Abroad Experience</h2>
            <p>During her study abroad experience in Rome, Katherine Ron immersed herself 
                in Italian language and culture, significantly enhancing her proficiency 
                in the language. Living in a new environment allowed her to adapt to different 
                cultural norms and practices while constantly traveling and exploring the city. 
                This experience also taught her how to manage and adapt to a demanding schedule, 
                balancing her academic responsibilities with her passion for discovering new places. 
                Katherine's time in Rome was a transformative period that broadened her horizons and 
                deepened her appreciation for diverse cultures.
